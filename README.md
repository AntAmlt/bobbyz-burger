# Bobby Z Burger Website

This website is made for fun after reading the comic book *Il faut flinguer Ramirez (Acte 2)*. The story is sprinkled of fake advertisements, newspaper articles... Among them, one for a fast-food restaurant called **Bobby Z Burger**.

Made with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS, it offers a great user experience, on large or small screens.
